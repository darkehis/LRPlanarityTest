Left-Right Planarity Criterion Test

This program tests wether a graph is planar using the Left-Right Planarity Criterion.

To run the program: 
-built it with ant (build.xml) with the command:
ant
-lauch the executable jar file created: java -jar LRPlanarityTest.jar [nameOfTheGraphWitoutDOTExtension]
where name of the graph is the filename of the .dot file located in graphs/ directory.

One new graph is cretaed int the graphs/ directory if and only if the graph is planar: 
-the oriented copy of the original graph NameOfTheGraph_oriented.dot
-taillabel of edge represent the embedding order.

The algorihtm used is in O(m + n).

/!\For now it only works with connected graphs. 
/!\ Vertices id must be integers
